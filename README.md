# CS465

This project used both traditional Express-based HTML/JavaScript rendering and a modern Angular Single Page Application (SPA). Express handled simple, server-rendered pages, while Angular provided a dynamic, client-side experience with real-time data binding and seamless navigation without page reloads. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexibility, scalability, and ability to store complex, schema-less JSON-like documents that align naturally with JavaScript-based applications.

JSON is a lightweight data format distinct from JavaScript code. It acts as the bridge between the Angular frontend and Express backend, allowing structured data to be exchanged through RESTful API calls. Code was refactored to simplify services and improve maintainability, such as consolidating API calls into shared Angular services. Reusable UI components, like form and trip display elements, reduced duplication and improved consistency across the application. The API used HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) mapped to RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations. JWT-based authentication secured protected routes, ensuring that only authorized users could modify or delete data. Testing included verifying endpoint responses and ensuring secure token handling across layers.

This course was my first delve into full-stack programming and has given me impactful insights and understanding on putting together all aspects of a project that includes both front end and backend elements. Having this project completed will strengthen my portfolio and hopefully demonstrates my skills in such a way that helps me land my first job as a developer. Having an understanding of the full-stack process is crucial for the modern developer, and this course has given me that, in addition to allowing me to continue refining my programming skills.
